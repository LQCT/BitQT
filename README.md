# BitQT
> A Graph-Based Approach to the  Quality Threshold Clustering of Molecular Dynamics

BitQT is a Python command-line interface (CLI) conceived to speed up
the Heyer's Quality Threshold (QT) clustering [1] of long Molecular Dynamics.
The package implements a heuristic approach to [this exact variant
of QT](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00558).
