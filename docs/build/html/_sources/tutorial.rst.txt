Case Study Tutorials
====================
Here you can find a simple example on how to run a clustering job using BitQT as well
as how to visualize the clusters using a VMD plugin.


Clustering a MD
---------------
.. note:: We included an example folder where you can find the topology and trajectory files
          we have used in this example

As we already mentioned, the only required argument for BitQT is the trajectory file. We will use 
the binary dcd file *aligned_original_tau_6K.dcd*. As this file does not contain topological information, 
it is necessarty to pass the -top argument to BitQT with an appropiate topology file. In our case, the topology
will be the PDB formatted file *aligned_tau.pdb*. 

If you run ::

  $ bitQT -top -traj -sel -cutoff -outdir


Visualizing Clusters in VMD
